# vue-portfolio

This is a remake version of [my original portfolio page](https://kalliu.com) using Vue.js, on the same week I started learning the framework.

It is still a work in progress. The goal is to achieve a perfect copy, including reponsiveness.

## Project setup

It's a basic webpage that uses Vite as a bundler. To run it, just clone the repo and run `npm install` and `npm run dev`.
