      ü•Å First of all, I am a passionate

      This photo you see is from my beloved geek music project,
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Museek" target="_blank"> Museek</a>, where I wear the hats
      of drummer, producer, manager and sometimes singer. We&apos;ve reached over 4 million plays on
      Spotify with 54k+ monthly listeners and I am really proud of it!

      üßëüèª‚Äçüíª In 2019, as a <b>Software Engineer</b>, I focused on Front End development, combining my
      design expertise with data-driven insights to craft robust web applications with a clear User
      Experience (UX). With my skills in Amazon Web Services (AWS), I now focus on creating
      end-to-end web applications that ensure high availability.

      energize the work environment, as well as my ability to inject solid ideas and innovative
      concepts into every project.
